# funtest

Download this git repository to prepare:

```
git clone git@github.com:ohjames/funtest.git
cd funtest
npm install
```

Fill in the functions `countNumberOfFruits` and `calculateTotalFarmerFruitCost`
in `fruit/farmers.js`. There are tests in the repository to see if they work
which can be run like this:

```
npm test
```

You should not need to look at `lib.js` to complete this test,
consequently you must not edit it either.

`bluebird` is provided but you can use a different promise implementation if
you want. Your solution should be functional in nature, `lodash` is provided
but replace it with something else (e.g. lazy.js/underscore) if you want.
